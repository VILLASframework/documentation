MATLAB (matrix laboratory) is a multi-paradigm numerical computing environment and proprietary programming language developed by MathWorks. MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, Fortran and Python.

Integration of MATLAB with VILLASnode is relatively is relatively easy by using MATLABs [Instrument Control Toolbox](https://de.mathworks.com/help/instrument/index.html).
The Instrument Control Toolbox provides a [`udp()` function](https://de.mathworks.com/help/instrument/udp.html) which can be used to open UDP/IP connections to remote systems like VILLASnode.

**Note:** Please note that MATLAB is usually not suited for real-time operation. Please have a look at OPAL-RTs RT-Lab environment if real-time execution is a requirement.

## Example

Please have a look at the [`clients/matlab/`](https://github.com/VILLASframework/node/tree/master/clients/matlab) directory for an exemplary VILLASnode configuration file and MATLAB code.

You can run this example by execution this `receiver` script in your MATLAB prompt and starting VILLASnode by running the following command in your shell:

```shell
villas-node villas.conf
```

### Output

The following figure shows the output of the MATLAB `plot()` function with the signals generated by the [`signal` node-type](../nodes/signal.md).
