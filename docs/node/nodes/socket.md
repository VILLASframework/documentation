# Sockets

The socket node-type is the most comprehensive and complex one.
It allows to send and receive simulation data over the network.
Internally it uses the well known [BSD socket API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets).

Please note that only datagram / packet, connection-less based network protocols are supported.
This means that there's currently no support for TCP!

The implementation supports multiple protocols / OSI layers:

 - **Data-Link Layer 2:** Raw Ethernet Frames (no routing!)
 - **Network Layer 3:** Raw IP (internet / VPN routing possible)
 - **Transport Layer 4:** UDP encapsulation, TCP client or server

## Prerequisites

This node-type does not have any special library dependencies. It is always available.

Optionally, [libnl3](http://www.infradead.org/~tgr/libnl/) is used to setup network emulation as described in page [Netem Emulation](../netem.md).

## Implementation

The source code of the node-type is available here:
https://github.com/VILLASframework/node/blob/master/lib/nodes/socket.cpp

## Configuration {#config}

For TCP connection, the node can only be either server or client which is specified by "tcp-server" or "tcp-client" in the layer section.

import ApiSchema from '@theme/ApiSchema';

<ApiSchema id="node" example pointer="#/components/schemas/socket" />

## Example

``` url="external/node/etc/examples/nodes/socket.conf" title="node/etc/examples/nodes/socket.conf"
nodes = {
	udp_node = {					# The dictionary is indexed by the name of the node.
		type = "socket",			# For a list of available node-types run: 'villas-node -h'
		vectorize = 30,				# Receive and sent 30 samples per message (combining).
		samplelen = 10				# The maximum number of samples this node can receive

		builtin = false,			# By default, all nodes will have a few builtin hooks attached to them.
									# When collecting statistics or measurements these are undesired.

	### The following settings are specific to the socket node-type!! ###

							#	- tcp-client Send / receive byte stream as a TCP server
