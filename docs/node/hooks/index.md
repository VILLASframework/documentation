# Hook-types

Sometimes forwarded sample data shall be modified or filtered.
VILLASnode supports _hooks_ for this purpose.
Hooks are simple callback functions which are called whenever a message is processed by a path.

There are several built-in hooks for:
  - collecting, show & reset statistics
  - drop reordered messages
  - verify message metadata
  - handle simulation restarts
  - remapping values of a sample
  - overwriting / updating timestamps
  - converting data-types
  - down-sampling

But main goal of this mechanism is to provide extensibility for the end user.
Example applications for hooks might be:

 1. Filter sample values
 2. Manipulate sample values: FIR
 3. Transform sample values: FFT, DCT
 4. Update network emulation settings based on sample values

Hooks can be added to the processing pipeline in three places:

- **Node-read:**  Every time a sample is received from a node
- **Node-write:** Every time a sample is sent to a node
- **Path:**       Every time a sample is processed within a path

Some hooks are built-in hooks which are by default enabled without a corresponding section in the configuration file.
Usually, built-in hooks have no configurable options.

Currently, the following _node-hook-types_ are supported:

| Type                            | Built-in  | Node-read | Node-write | Path | State      | Comment |
