# Print Sample Data

The `print` hook prints processed samples to the standard output or into a file.
While doing so, it supports all the formats described here: [Format Types](../formats/index.md) .
It can also optionally prefix each line of output with a user definable prefix in order to distinguish the output of multiple `print` hooks.

## Implementation

The source code of the hook is available here:
https://github.com/VILLASframework/node/blob/master/lib/hooks/print.cpp

## Configuration

import ApiSchema from '@theme/ApiSchema';

<ApiSchema id="node" example pointer="#/components/schemas/print" />

## Example

``` url="external/node/etc/examples/hooks/print.conf" title="node/etc/examples/hooks/print.conf"
@include "hook-nodes.conf"

paths = (
	{
		in = "signal_node"
		out = "file_node"

		hooks = (
			{
				type = "print",

				output = "print_output_file.log"
				format = "villas.human"
				# prefix = "[file_node] " # prefix and output are exclusive settings!
			}
		)
	}
)
```
