# Network Emulation

VILLASnode supports the emulation of wide-area network characteristics.

This emulation can be configured on a per-node basis for **outgoing** (egress) data only.
Incoming data is not processed by the network emulation!

This network emulation is handled by Linux's [netem queuing discipline](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/networking/netem), which is part of the traffic control subsystem.
Take a look at the following manual page for supported metrics: [tc-netem(8)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-netem.8.html).

VILLASnode only takes care of setting up and initializing the netem queuing discipline inside the kernel.
For this, the iproute2 software package (`ip` & `tc` commands) must be installed.
The configuration is done via the configuration file.
Look at `etc/example.conf` for a section called `netem` or `tc-netem(8)` for more details.

## Fix for Fedora

For some reason, Fedora installs the delay distribution profiles under `/usr/lib64/tc/`,
but libnl3 only searches in `/usr/lib/tc/`. This results in the following error when using netem:

``` # noqa MD040
Invalid delay distribution 'normal' in netem config in
```

To fix this error, please add a symlink: `ln -s /usr/lib64/tc /usr/lib/tc`

## Custom delay distribution

Netem supports loading custom delay distributions.

1. Load and compile the netem tools from:
   https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/shemminger/iproute2.git/tree/netem
2. Create a custom distribution by following the steps described here:
   https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/shemminger/iproute2.git/tree/README.distribution
3. Put the generated distribution with the suffix `.dist` in the `tc` library directory:  `/usr/lib/tc/`.
4. Load the distribution by specifying the basename in the server configuration.

## Configuration

import ApiSchema from '@theme/ApiSchema';

<ApiSchema id="node" pointer="#/components/schemas/netem" />

# Example

``` url="external/node/etc/examples/nodes/netem.conf" title="node/etc/examples/nodes/netem.conf"
nodes = {
	udp_node = {					# The dictionary is indexed by the name of the node.
		type = "socket",			# For a list of available node-types run: 'villas-node -h'

	### The following settings are specific to the socket node-type!! ###

		format	= "gtnet",			# For a list of available node-types run: 'villas-node -h'

		in = {
			address = "127.0.0.1:12001"	# This node only received messages on this IP:Port pair
		},
		out = {
			address = "127.0.0.1:12000",	# This node sends outgoing messages to this IP:Port pair
		
			netem = {			# Network emulation settings
				enabled = true,
							# These settings can be specified for each node individually!
				delay = 100000,		# Additional latency in microseconds
				jitter = 30000,		# Jitter in Âµs
				distribution = "normal", # Distribution of delay: uniform, normal, pareto, paretonormal
				loss = 10,		# Packet loss in percent
				duplicate = 10,		# Duplication in percent
				corrupt = 10		# Corruption in percent
			}
		}
	}
}
```
