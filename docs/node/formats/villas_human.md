# Custom VILLAS Human Readable

This is a simple human-readable format commonly used for logging or debugging:
The format is similar to a conventional CSV (comma separated values) file.
Every line in a file correspondents to a message / sample of simulation data.
The columns of a line are separated by whitespaces (tabs or spaces).
The columns are defined as follows:

    seconds.nanoseconds+offset(sequenceno)	value0 value1 ... valueN

 1. The first column contains a timestamp which is composed of up to 4 parts:
     - Number of seconds after 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC
     - A dot: '.'
     - Number of nano seconds of the current second (optional)
     - An offset between the point in time when a message was sent and received (optional)
     - The sequence number of the message (optional)

     A valid timestamp can be generated by the following Unix command: `date +%s.%N`.
     *Important:* The second field is not the fractional part of the second!!!

 2. Maximum `MSG_VALUES` floating point values per sample. The values are separated by whitespaces as well.

## Implementation

The source code of the format-type is available here:
https://github.com/VILLASframework/node/blob/master/lib/formats/villas_human.cpp

## Configuration {#config}

import ApiSchema from '@theme/ApiSchema';

<ApiSchema id="node" example pointer="#/components/schemas/villas_human" />

## Example Configuration {#example}

``` url="external/node/etc/examples/formats/villas-human.conf" title="node/etc/examples/formats/villas-human.conf"
nodes = {
	node = {
		type = "file"
		uri = "/dev/null"

		format = {
			type = "villas.human"

			comment_prefix = "#"
			header = false
		}
	}
}
```

## Example Payload {#payload}

This example shows a dump with three values per sample:

```
# seconds.nanoseconds(sequence)	signal0 signal1 signal2
1438959964.162102394(6)	3.489760	-1.882725	0.860070
```
